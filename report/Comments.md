# Comments from Neave


## General

- Main report focusing on one algorithm and time period [DONE]

- Check out data journals

- Change format in order to show results immediately after discussing methods [DONE]


## Specific

* Discuss data in more detail (SECURE LAB):

   - Coverage on industry and regions (ratios between ASHE/BRES dataset)
    
   - Check out who is the people that we leave out (after collection)
     
   - Tables with number of people we have in the sample (per year, in total) 
   
   - A bar chart with number of employees per sector. 
   
   - Aggregation at 3-digit code

* Transition that exceed 10 counts or >= than 10 ? [FIXED]

* Make clear to explain what is symmetrical counts or not

* Be clear of what the tables of total flows show (what are we counting).

* Talk about percentage of non-zero entries. [DONE]

* Discuss the sparsity earlier on, show adjacency matrices earlier. [DONE]

* Adjacency matrix change color from white to dark. Add a grid with the sectors. 
Add a counts adjacency matrix. 


* Top 20 tables in Counts and Weights. [DONE]

* Fix confusing text on what is driving to the higher weights with low counts.

* Explain the X axis cut on the count distribution. [FIXED]

* Degree/centrality: 
    - A bar graph of what is the mean centrality for each 1 digit sector. [DONE]
    - Discuss about the choosing of the metrics
    
* Visualisation with nodes colored with the 1-digit sector. [DONE]

* Make clear if we are using the log employment as node size. [FIXED]

* Matrix between industries (1-digit) and clusters from community detection.

* Draw lines on the minimums of information corresponding to the times that we chose. [DONE]

* Label tau on the figures and the sectors labeling all the figures. [DONE]

* Dendrogram
