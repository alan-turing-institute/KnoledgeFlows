# Introduction 

This report describes the procedure of constructing skill-relatedness matrices for
the United Kingdom. Skill-relatedness aims to provide a quantitative estimate of similarities between two industries
 in terms of their human capital requirements [@GermanyMatricesReport].
 
The matrices are built over two periods of time (1997-2008 and 2009-2018), and two industrial classifications (SI2003 and 
 SIC2007).  For each period of time, a sample of employee jobs is taken from HM Revenue & Customs PAYE records, and
 their transitions between industries are recorded. These transitions are then used to build the skill-relatedness matrices.
 
The structure of this report is as follows. The dataset used to build the skill-relatedness matrices are described in 
section \ref{data}. Then, the method to measure the transitions between industries is described in section \ref{method}.
A statistical procedure is applied to convert the observed labor transitions to a metric that reflect the skill relatedness
between the industries, this is described in section \ref{SR}. Finally, in section \ref{results} the resulting matrices are
described and a preliminary network analysis is shown.
