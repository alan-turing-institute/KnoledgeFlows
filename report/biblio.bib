  abstract={\&quot;This document provides a brief overview on the construction of skill-relatedness matrices for Germany. The datasets for these matrices are available for free online download on the homepage of the Research Data Centre at the IAB. We explain the statistical procedure to derive the skill-relatedness measure and describe the resulting skill-relatedness matrices with network graphs. The downloadable datasets contain estimates of skill-relatedness between all pairs of industries using four different industrial classification systems and among all pairs of occupations (KldB88). More detailed information on these issues is to be found in the companion paper by Neffke et al. (2016).\&quot; (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en)) Additional Information Matrices},
